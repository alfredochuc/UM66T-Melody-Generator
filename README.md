## Working
**UM66T:**

The UM66T is an CMOS LSI designed for musical applications and has an on-chip ROM
containing a musical tune. The deice has very low power consumption (around 180mW)
since it is fabricated using the CMOS process. The IC includes an inbuilt oscillation
circuit. Hence a compact melody module can be constructed with only a few additional
components.

An input trigger enables the tone generator unit which in turn drives an external speaker unit.
The tone generator unit consists of the Oscillator, Rhythm generator, Tempo generator and ROM.
The oscillator frequency is used as a time for tone and beat generators. Its accuracy affects the quality of the
music.

A 5VDC power adapter is used as the power supply. Since the UM66T has a maximum supply voltage of 4.5V,
a 100Œ© resistor is used to reduce the supply voltage to a suitable 3.3V.
When the SPDT slide switch is turned ON, the UM66T is triggered and produces a melody signal that begins
from the first note due to the power on reset feature. An external transistor amplifies the signal and it's output is
connected to a speaker. An LED turns on whenever the circuit is triggered.
